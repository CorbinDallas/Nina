JavaScript User Interface Library

##Welcome##

Nina is a free open source JavaScript UI library.  Currently Nina is a work in progress.

##Goals##

Nina aims to reproduce all common widgets used in application construction.  Dialogs, Tabs, Grids, Tree Views,
Forms and much more.

##Why Build Another JavaScript UI Library##

Existing UI Libraries use one or more of these undesirable features. 

* Implements non standard event handling systems.
* Reliance upon HTML that already exists in the DOM.
* Not styleable or customizable.
* Not free and/or open source.
* Doesn't implement enough events.
* Doesn't have enough widgets.
* Doesn't integrate well with server side data systems.
* Lacks consistency in widget implementation.
* Difficult to use and/or unintuitive syntax.

One of the main goals of Nina is to overcome these undesirable properties.  Nina is a pure
JavaScript UI, no writing HTML tags.  Nina is well documented and easy to use.
Nina is powerful, and will integrate with REST APIs seamlessly.  Nina is all you
need to createpowerful client side user interface for any web application.

##What can it do right now?##

Not much.  Nina is in its early stages of being written.  For an updated list of what's happening
